Notes and changes to Foscam CGI documentation v. 1.0.4:
=======================================================

getWifiConfig:
- is admin only
- result of PSK is urlencoded (since 1.11.1.18, I think)

snapPicture2
- max. pic size is 512000 bytes
  Workaround: decrease quality setting, or use snapPicture and follow the link

getPTZspeed/setPTZspeed
- contrary to doc: 0: very fast, 4: very slow

setOSDSetting
- parameter `isEnableOSDMask` not working

setOSDMask
- undocumented CGI call
- parameter: isEnableOSDMask

getOSDMask
- undocumented CGI call
- same reseult as getOSDSetting
